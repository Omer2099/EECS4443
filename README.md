Limitations:
The stored login information is stored in the emulator's memory and is cleared when the emulator is turned off. Thus, registered users can’t use their credentials to log in when running the app for a second time. This is a data management limitation that could be overcome by saving the login info in a database or in a file on the phone/emulator.
